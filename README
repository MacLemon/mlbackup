Disclaimer:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This software is provided as-is. It is in beta status and should be treated as such. MacLemon Backup has proven to work fine on _my_ servers, but please do not solely rely on the backups made with MacLemon Backup. As usual, alwas have a second backup ffor vital data. No support can be given at the moment. I hope to have user self-support (forum or similar way) available in the future. I will post relevant information on the mlbackup website.


Target Audience:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mac OS X Admins and Geek Users who like a nice intelligent and incremental backup through the shell. Can be run from launchd (or cron) if you like. This is NOT INTENDED for normal users (yet). mlbackup is explicitly targeted at the Mac OS X (10.4 Tiger and above) platform. It has not been tested on other software platforms! Mac OS X 10.4.10 or higher (Server as well) is recommended.


Download:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can always get the latest version of mlbackup at http://maclemon.at/mlbackup


Installation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See INSTALL on how to install all the necessary files to use MacLemon backup.


Usage:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Duplicate the provided sample configuration file found in /etc/maclemon/backup/demo.mlbackupconf.sample after installation. (Do NOT edit and use this file as your working configuration as it will be overwritten with a newer version if you update mlbackup.)
The sample config is well documented and should be easy for an admin to fill out all the necessary variables to get a working configuration for your purpose. If you find any parameters complex or unintuitive to use send us feedback on how we can improve this!


Additions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will definitely change soon!

None of these are mandatory, but they provide some comfort and help to beautify your backups.

Growl:
NOTE: Growl notifications are currently NOT available until a later date in the development cycle.
If you have growl and growlnotify installed, mlbackup will try to make use of it. For more info on growl see http://growl.info/


OSXutils:
If you have osxutils installed, mlbackup will try to make use of them. 	For more info on osxutils see http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxutils/

	
fink project:
See http://fink.sf.net/ for info on fink.
You can use `fink install osxutils` to install osxutils if you have fink.


Known Issues:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No manpage for mlbackup yet

Spotlight comments (Finder comments) are not backupped reliably at the moment. This will be improved soon!
	
ACL (Access Control Lists) are not backupped correctly, if at all. (rsync problem)
	
The Backup set may NOT include german umlaut characters. (I am still investigating why this is the case. If you have any information on how to make this work, please contact me!) This issue ONLY affects the naming of the backup sets. The files you intend to backup are not affected and will be backupped just fine!


Feedback:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please direct all feedback, bug-reports, feature-requests and suggestions to mlbackup@maclemon.at . (In english or german language.) Support requests can not be handled on this email address and will be ignored.


Enjoy using mlbackup!
