Disclaimer:
	This software is provided as-is. It is in early alpha status and should be treated as such. Please do not solely rely on the backups made with MacLemon Backup.


Installation:
	See INSTALL on how to install all the necessary files to use MacLemon backup.


Usage:
	Create a config file for your backup.
	Copy the included sampleconfig and edit the values accordingly.
	The sample config you can find in /etc/maclemon/backup/demo.mlbackupconf.sample is (hopefully) well enough documented.


Additions:
	None of these are mandatory, but they provide some comfort.

	If you have growl installed, mlbackup will make use of it.
	For more info on growl see http://grwol.info/


	If you have osxutils installed via fink, mlbackup will make use of it.
	For more info on osxutils see http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxutils/
	You can run `fink install osxutils` to install them if you have fink.
	See http://fink.sf.net/ for info on fink.



Known Bugs:
	no manpage for mlbackup yet
	If you backup to an external drive and that drive is not available when mlbackup runs there is no exception handling yet (in the works)
