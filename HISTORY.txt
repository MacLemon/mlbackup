# What's new?
------------------------------------------------------------

## mlbackup 190
### New features in mlbackup
- An alias named "Latest" is now created after each successful backup pointing to the latest finished backup.
- Added a new config option $MLcustomRsyncOptions that allows custom and per configuration rsync options to be used. This option is passed after all mlbackup native options and may be suitable to override these.

#### new features in the admin email message
- The admin email now contains a link to my flattr button https://flattr.com/thing/141895/mlbackup and encourages users to make a donation to support further development.
- The admin email message will now report the start and end timestamps of each backup.
- The amount of free space on the MLdestPath is now reported in the admin email message.
- Configfile, backup source and destination are now reported in the admin email message.
- When reporting that there are ERROR backups the destination path is now added to the Admin Email.
- Report Emails now will include a human readable error message for fatal and non-fatal errors.

#### globalexclusions
- global exclusions: Added exclusion of TimeMachine local snapshots used in 10.7 and higher


### Improvements
#### Admin email message
- improved wording for debug messages and admin email.

#### globalexclusions
- global exclusions is now sorted in: system and global/usual things, Apple things, files created by GUI applications., Resorted Apple OS's, Fixed two typos in globalexclusions - Thanks to @zettt for the patch!

### Bugfixes
- Fixed the way the install.sh script handles detection of systems that need the postfix fix.
- Corrected a bug that would try to fix postfix on 10.7 and fail. This part is now only run on 10.[456]. Also fixes a bug with the installer package that would report failure where it actually did install just fine.
- Fixed a minor typo in handling of the comment added to a backup if setfcomment is installed by fink.
- Corrected a typo in case rsync reported an error to include a human readable error message in the admin email.

### mlbackup
- Added error message 127 "Rsync not found on remote machine, probably mlbackup not installed." - Thanks to Yene for the patch!
- Corrected a typo in the README.
- Updated MLinfoURL to point users to github for updates instead of maclemon.at
- Improved stability: Quoted a few file variables. These are extremley unlikely (if possible at all) to contain spaces but for safety reasons they were quoted.
- More robust detection of concurrent invocation of mlbackup with the same config file.
- More robust detection of the most recent backup to refer to for hard links.
- Improved handling and cleanup of OLD, ERROR and crashed backups that leave a .pid tag and .noindex folder.
- More robust detection of which backups to rotate.
