#
# This is the global exclusions file for backlemon. Files and folders mentioned 
# in this file will be EXCLUDED from your backup!
#
# To have one of these still backed up, use your personal inclusions an
# exclusions file for a backup. See man rsync for more info on how to write
# these or learn from the comments in this file.
#
# Please send ANY suggestions, corrections or other files/folders that should
# be included in this file to pepi@maclemon.at (In english or german language)
# If you are the author of a software that keeps cache data in uncommon places
# that may safely be left out from a backup, please contact me with the details
# so that I can add these locations to this exclusions file.
#
# Things we consider for future exclusion are at the end of the file. Any info 
# regarding these files is welcome.
#
# To learn more about rsync include/exclude patterns see the rsync manpage!

############################ SECURITY WARNING #################################
###############################################################################
# If you don't know about the safety of your data on the
# location you save your backup to, you may want to SKIP these as your 
# keychains may contain vital and private login data as well as your encryption
# private keys and certificates!
#
# Keychain files are protected by a password (usually your login password)
# so make sure at least that password is really good.
#
# In that case you should backup your keychains to ANOTHER location that you 
# know your files are safe on!
# (Like your private iPod, USB Stick, external Drive, etc.)
#
# If the line below this block begins with a comment "#" or ";" then your 
# keychain files will be backuped!

###############################################################################
# This ONLY applies to wired versions BELOW 1.3. Since 1.3 passwords are stored

#
# SECURITY WARNING: This file contains login data to your wired bookmarks in
# PLAIN TEXT! If you're not sure your backup location is safe from prying eyes
# you may want to skip this file and backup to another location.
#
# Since Mac OS 10.4 .plist files are usually stored as binary XML files.
# This takes about 15 seconds more to get to the plain text passwords.
# Conclusion, it's just as unsave as before! Take care!
