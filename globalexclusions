# be included in this file to pepi@maclemon.at (In english or german language)
# If you are the author of a software that keeps cache data in uncommon places
# that may safely be left out from a backup, please contact me with the details
# so that I can add these locations to this exclusions file.

############################ SECURITY WARNING #################################
###############################################################################
# If you don't know about the safety of your data on the
# location you save your backup to, you may want to SKIP these as your 
# keychains may contain vital and private login data as well as your encryption
# private keys and certificates!
#
# Keychain files are protected by a password (usually your login password)
# so make sure at least that password is really good.
#
# In that case you should backup your keychains to ANOTHER location that you 
# know your files are safe on!
# (Like your private iPod, USB Stick, external Drive, etc.)
#
# If the line below this block begins with a comment "#" or ";" then your

# SECURITY WARNING: This file contains login data to your wired bookmarks in

#
# Since Mac OS 10.4 .plist files are usually stored as binary XML files.
# This takes about 15 seconds more to get to the plain text passwords.
# Conclusion, it's just as unsave as before! Take care!
