MacLemon Backup - INSTALL

/etc/maclemon/backup/demo.mlbackupconf.sample
/etc/maclemon/backup/globalexclusions
/usr/local/bin/mlbackup
/usr/local/bin/growler.sh


For the email notification to work make sure that /usr/bin/mail correctly works on your system. (maybe through sendmail or the postfix sendmail wrapper)
