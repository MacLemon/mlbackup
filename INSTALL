MacLemon Backup - INSTALL

There are two ways to install mlbackup on your Mac.

The easy way:
Use the Installer package to install mlbackup and the required rsync 3 on your Mac. This is the recommended way and should work via the graphical Installer.app, /usr/sbin/installer on the command line, or even Apple Remote Desktop.

The manual way:
Use the included install.sh script to copy all the mlbackup files to your Mac. This DOES NOT install the REQUIRED rsync 3 automatically. You can build rsync 3 from the included sources which you can also obtain from 
It is likely that you need to edit the rsync path in /usr/local/bin/mlbackup manually when building your own rsync.

For the email notification to work make sure that /usr/bin/mail correctly works on your system.



The following files will be placed on your system:

/etc/maclemon/backup/demo.mlbackupconf.sample
A sample configuration file which you are encouraged to duplicate, rename and put your configuration option into. Do not directly edit this file as it will be overwritten by newer installations of the mlback install.sh script.


/etc/maclemon/backup/globalexclusions
A file containing files and folders which should not be backed up on Mac OS X or which are just plain nonsense to backup (like caches). Do not edit this file directly, use a per configuration exclusion file for your needs instead to override the settings in here.


/usr/local/bin/mlbackup
The main mlbackup skript that does most of the magic.


/usr/local/maclemon/bin/rsync
/usr/local/maclemon/share/man/man1/rsync.1
/usr/local/maclemon/share/man/man5/rsyncd.conf.5
The great rsync 3 and man pages that empower mlbackup and do the rest of the magic.
