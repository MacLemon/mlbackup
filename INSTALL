MacLemon Backup - INSTALL

To install MacLemon backup run install.sh with sudo (or as root, though sudo is recommended). 

The following files will be placed on your system:

/etc/maclemon/backup/demo.mlbackupconf.sample
A sample configuration file which you are encouraged to duplicate, rename and put your configuration option into. Do not directly edit this file as it will be overwritten by newer installations of the mlback install.sh script.


/etc/maclemon/backup/globalexclusions
A file containing files and folders which should not be backed up on Mac OS X or which are just plain nonsense to backup (like caches). Do not edit this file directly, use a per configuration exclusion file for your needs instead to override the settings in here.


/usr/local/bin/mlbackup
The main mlbackup skript that does all the magic.


/usr/local/bin/growler.sh
NOT in use at the moment. Meant to show growl notifications during mlbackup runs. Will be reactivated at a future time.


For the email notification to work make sure that /usr/bin/mail correctly works on your system.
